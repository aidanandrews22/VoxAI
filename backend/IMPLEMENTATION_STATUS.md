- ⏳ Vector embedding generation
- ⏳ Pinecone integration for vector storage

### RAG Implementation
- ⏳ Context retrieval from vector store
- ⏳ Query preprocessing
- ⏳ Response generation with LLM

## To Do

### API Endpoints
- ❌ Search endpoint for vector similarity search
- ❌ Chat endpoint with RAG integration
- ❌ File deletion endpoint
- ❌ File update endpoint

### Performance Optimization
- ❌ Caching strategies for repetitive requests
- ❌ Background tasks for non-blocking operations
- ❌ Connection pooling for database access

### Security
- ❌ JWT-based authentication with Supabase
- ❌ Rate limiting
- ❌ Input validation and sanitization

### Testing
- ❌ Unit tests for services
- ❌ Integration tests for API endpoints
- ❌ Performance benchmarks

## Next Steps
