Okay, this app is designed to be an llm-focused data interaction and note taking app. It is meant to either upload or record lectures and have them stored in the users personal db (just do local storage for now). Then the user needs to be able to interact with their recordings and notes in the main chat area. The main point of this app is that users can create notebooks that contain both personal notes, lecture notes (if uploaded), and lecture recordings. Then they are able to chat with all of this data seamlessly through the chatbot. The data in the db needs to be used as context for the llm calls. For now, just use open-ai api and store all data in local storage or in variables. The main entry point should allow users to see their notebooks and create new ones. Then they should be either prompted to upload data for a new notebook or see their existing notebook with chat/note-taking in the middle, with a sidebar that shows the currently attached "knowledge". When new notes are created add them to the knowledge. And have a seperate tab to manage lecture recordings. Most of the functionality doesnt actually have to work yet just get the ui and structure down
